viewportSize
============

A Safari Extension to show viewport size when resizing browser. You can make it only show the size when you have the Web Inspector enabled and embedded in the browser window (to the right or bottom) by enabling this option in the settings.

It's perfect when you're doing responsive design and use the Web Inspector to resize the viewport (like I do).
