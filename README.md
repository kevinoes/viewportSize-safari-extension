viewportSize
============

A Safari Extension to show viewport size when resizing browser. Can be enabled to only show when you have the Web Inspector enabled and embedded in the browser window (to the right or bottom).

Perfect when you're doing responsive design and use the Web Inspector to resize the viewport (like I do).
