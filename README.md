viewportSize
============

A Safari Extension to show viewport size when resizing browser. By default it's enabled to only show when you have the Web Inspector enabled and embedded in the browser window (to the right or bottom), you can change this in the settings.

It's perfect when you're doing responsive design and use the Web Inspector to resize the viewport (like I do).
